# Flight-fare-Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict flight fares using machine learning techniques. The model will analyze various features such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, and other relevant parameters to forecast the fare. The goal is to provide an accurate prediction model that can assist travelers in planning their trips and managing travel costs effectively.
Data

The dataset used for this project consists of flight fare information. It includes various features such as:

    Airline: The airline operating the flight.
    Date of Journey: The date on which the journey starts.
    Source: The departure city.
    Destination: The arrival city.
    Route: The route taken by the flight.
    Dep_Time: The departure time of the flight.
    Arrival_Time: The arrival time of the flight.
    Duration: The duration of the flight.
    Total_Stops: The number of stops between the source and destination.
    Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight.

Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing involves:

    Handling missing values.
    Converting categorical features into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
    Feature scaling.
